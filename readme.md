# Node.js Basics

This is my implementation of the Node.js project on Team Treehouse. To run it, enter: `node [app] [username1] [username2]`
on the command line to access the Team Treehouse API and look up the point and badge data for that user.

The app simply runs every command line argument passed via process.argv[2] onwards through the function defined in `profile.js`.
